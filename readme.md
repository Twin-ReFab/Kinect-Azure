# Kinect Azure

Grasshopper components to interact with a [Kinect Azure DK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kinect-dk/). 
The component __Azure Kinect Quick__ allows to directly capture and display a point cloud.
The other components allow finer control over the workflow and transformation from depth and color image to point cloud. 
Currently only a subset of the full functionality of the Kinect Azure is implemented.
